**Project Vision:** Digital Twin for Stem Cell Differentiation and Therapeutic Reprogramming


 **Goal:** AI for understanding developmental pathways

**Our mission** is to accelerate recovery from cancer, enable next-generation vaccine creation, and combat autoimmune diseases through advanced cellular reprogramming integrated with a digital twin of wet-lab stem cell differentiation experiments. This digital twin will replicate the complex molecular and epigenetic dynamics of stem cell differentiation in silico, allowing bioinformaticians and experimental biologists to simulate, optimize, and refine cellular behavior in real time.

Cascading activations were found to be redundant and did not yield performance improvements. Therefore, our focus shifts toward model compression and mitigating overfitting through the use of cascaded model compression techniques. **Choose either a convex or a nonconvex activation function, do not combine or alternate between them in staged training**.
