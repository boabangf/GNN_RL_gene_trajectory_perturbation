The goal of this project is to transform the gene regulatory system into GNN and reinforcement  for predicting the effect of gene perturbations on developmental trajectories using single-cell RNA-seq data

Variational Graph Autoencoder (VGAE) – a graph autoencoder variant that uses variational inference to learn a probabilistic latent representation of graph-structured data.

Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCN) – a neural network architecture that generalizes convolution to graph domains. 

Model free reinforcement learning-sample inefficient
Model based reinforcement learning- Sample efficient
